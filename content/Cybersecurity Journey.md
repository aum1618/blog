title: Cybersecurity Journey
---
I was overwhelmed when I started cybersecurity. I did not know what to learn and where to learn it from. The certificate path was easy. just get a few certificates , prepare them well and you are good to go. But they are very expensive. I don't have that kind of money so I had to do learn everything for free without paying a single penny. I did a lot of research and these are the topics I came up with
